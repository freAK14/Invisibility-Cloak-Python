# Invisibility-Cloak-Python

## Requirements:

Python Libraries
* NumPy
* OpenCV
* time

Physical Requirements:
* Red colored cloth(saturated and solid)

```
Note: Incase you wish to use a different colored cloth, you would need to change the hsv(hue saturation value) parameters in the code.
I've used a solid red colored cloth. Preferably use pure Red, Green or Blue colors since they are the most saturated options.
```
## How To Use:
* Run the script and wait for around 3-5 seconds without you being in the frame.(To capture the background which we will use later to replace the pixels of cloth.)
* Then, try out the output yourself with your newly cretaed Invisiblity Cloak, just like Harry Potter.
